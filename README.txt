This is Rainbow Raider, a game developed in python
===============================
To run the game, ensure python 2.7 and all site packages are installed (PIL, pygame, and simpleGUI). Only simpleGUI was uploaded here. The others must be downloaded from the Internet to correctly run the py file. Graphic assets must be in a folder C:/GJ Images.
